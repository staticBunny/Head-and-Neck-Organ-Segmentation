Make a saved_images_<structure> directory in each model directory.
To run a model, run the train.py script in the model's directory.

The implemented models are inspired by the following:
U-Net and UNet++: https://github.com/4uiiurz1/pytorch-nested-unet
TransUNet: https://github.com/mkara44/transunet_pytorch

The pre-trained UNet model is taken from https://github.com/mateuszbuda/brain-segmentation-pytorch
